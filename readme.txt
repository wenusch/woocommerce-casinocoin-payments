WooCommerce XRP is a payment gateway for WooCommerce that easily lets you accept XRP as payments method.

== Description ==
WooCommerce XRP is a payment gateway which makes it easy to accept [XRP](https://ripple.com/xrp) as a payment method. You can choose between multiple different cryptocurrency exchanges in order to get the XRP rates upon checkout. With the ease of [XRPL Webhooks](https://webhook.xrpayments.co), the order is updates in seconds after the payment is made. This is particularly useful if your customer is making a partial payment, since a new QR-code is generated with the correct amount left to pay.

== Installation ==
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/empatogen/woocommerce-xrp/archive/v1.0.2.zip) and unpack in your wp-content/plugins folder. Go to "WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments" and setup the plugin.
