# WooCommerce XRP

A payment gateway for [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) to easily accept [XRP](https://ripple.com/xrp) as a payment method.

## Requirements

* [PHP](https://php.net) 5.6 or greater (PHP 7.2 or higher is recommended)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 5.1 or greater
* [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) 3.5.6 or greater
* A "self-owned" and **activated** [XRP](https://ripple.com/xrp) account. (You may **not** use an Exchange!)
* You need an account at [XRPL Webhook](https://webhook.xrpayments.co) (see below)

## Installing

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-xrp` directory folder, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` screen in Wordpress.
1. Create a free account at [XRPL Webhook](https://webhook.xrpayments.co) and obtain your **API keys**. This is required as the plugin uses this webhook to update the checkout page whenever a payment is made.
1. Go to "WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments" and configure the plugin.

## FAQ ##

### Which XRP server (rippled) is used by default?

The node **s2.ripple.com** is being used to talk to the XRP network. This can easily be changed under *Advanced* and you can use any public XRP server.

### Which exchanges is supported?

You can specify between [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Bitbank](https://bitbank.cc/), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [Bitlish](https://bitlish.com/), [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/), [Bitrue](https://www.bitrue.com/), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), [Bittrex](https://www.bittrex.com), [Bitcoin Exchange Thailand](https://bx.in.th/) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) as the exchange to use when fetching the XRP rate when the customer is checking out.

### What does the bypass firewall feature do?

By default, we speak [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSON-RPC) on port 51234 with the XRP server. Some webservers are behind a firewall that doesn't allow outgoing traffic on non-standard ports. By enabling this feature, we talk to [cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/), using TLS on port 443, which then acts as a proxy and relays the traffic to the XRP server.
